# CSS3 Spinner

Ajax spinner done in pure HTML & CSS3. No JavaScript included and no fallback is provided.

---

This site uses the following CSS3 techniques:

* Keyframe Animations
* Translations
* Transforms (rotation)

---

I added vendor specific prefixes for the css properties (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-) and the default W3C properties. The site was tested in the following browsers:

* Chrome 23
* Safari 6
* Firefox 16
* Opera 12
* Internet Explorer 10
* Mobile Safari (iOS5, iOS6)
* Android Browser (Android 4)
